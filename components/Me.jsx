        A problem-loving coder at heart with a passion for clear communication and clean code. For the last couple of years I have 
        been working on learning developing different kind of applications, mainly using the .NET platform but also recently looking 
        at front end and JavaScript. <br /><br />I am currently studying at Campus Varberg, a two year program which focus on the .NET platform 
        and courses on agile work methods, front end-development and database creation and administration. <br /><br /> ðŸ’¥ Currently looking for 
        a internship for the fall of 2023, feel free to contact me if this sounds interesting to you or anyone you may know! ðŸ’¥
