        A problem-solving coder at heart with a passion for clear communication and learning new tech. For the last couple of years I have 
        been working on learning to develop different kinds of applications, mainly using the .NET platform but also recently looking 
        at front end and JavaScript. <br /><br />I am currently studying at <a href="https://campus.varberg.se/yrkeshogskola/systemutvecklare-net" 
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Campus Varberg</a>, a two year program that focus on the .NET platform 
        with courses on agile work methods, front end-development and database creation and administration. <br /><br />
        ðŸ’¥ Currently looking for an internship for the fall of 2023, I love working with C#, JS, SQL, React and .NET to name a few, but I also love 
        learning new tech, front or back end. Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:mqvarnstrom80@gmail.com?subject=Hello!">mqvarnstrom80@gmail.com</a> if 
        this sounds interesting to you or anyone you may know! ðŸ’¥
