### Introduction  
  This is my personal webpage / portfolio, build with React / Next.js and tailwind css. I have tried to keep a simple and clean design that is responsive and mobile friendly. It has two dynamic features that uses the Github REST API to fetch my latest Github events and the Github GraphQL API to fetch my pinned repositories. I have also tried to make it accessable in regards to color choices and fonts.
    
### Features    
  + See my latest Github events
  + See my pinned projects on Github
  + Responsive design
    
### Tech stack

  + HTML + CSS
  + JavaScript
  + Deployment on Vercel
  + Apollo & GraphQL dependencie  
  
### Deployment & Running the app
I found deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) easy, making changes to this repo also automatically updates the app on the server so maintaining and updating the app couldn't be much easier imo.
